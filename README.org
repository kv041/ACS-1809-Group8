This file should show what needs to be done.
* TODO Compile the group submissions for Introduction and Organization
John : I didn't do this yet
* DONE Create a git repository.
Here it is.
* TODO Create product list
Create a list of books to sell. Divide them into categories as specified by site map.

Consider these links:
1. https://github.com/techgaun/awesome-electronics for the Datasheet/Technical manual section
2. https://github.com/Kiloreux/awesome-robotics#readme scroll to bookls section
3. https://github.com/HQarroum/awesome-iot#books
4. https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing#readme project management, each link lists to a list of books, can be mined for "testimonials" and reviews.
5. https://github.com/joho/awesome-code-review#books Project management, programming
6. https://github.com/ellisonleao/magictools#books
7. https://leadership-library.dev/

   
* TODO Site map
** DONE create a page structure document
this document briefly outlines each page of the website and roughly what it looks like. We can use this as a guide to design each page.
** TODO think of way to divide categories of books.
This would be based on the Audience Subtypes.
/in progress/ There is a rough division in the page-structure document, however, finding the links of books might cause a retooling of these structures.
** TODO Draw site map
I'm going to try doing this on graph paper...
welcome to suggestions here.
** TODO Find software to create site map diagrams.
One potential is dia, a diagram making software.
** TODO actually create site map

* TODO Create a product page template
** TODO create a product description template
A text template for title, author, isbn, description, and rating.
** TODO John: create database for above information
I'll try hand in writing a program that creates a JavaDB of our book titles.
