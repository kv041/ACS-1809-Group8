              Barr Group's Embedded C Coding Standard was developed to minimize bugs in firmware by focusing on practical rules that keep bugs out, while also improving the maintainability and portability of embedded software. The coding standard details a set of guiding principles as well as specific naming conventions and other rules for the use of data types, functions, preprocessor macros, variables and much more. Individual rules that have been demon- strated to reduce or eliminate certain types of bugs are highlighted1

              In this book we will cover some finer points of more advanced programming aspects in the Java language. General programming guidelines and the use of exceptions in Java will be the subjects discussed. 
              Coding standards for Java lead to greater consistency within the code as a whole. Improved consistency produces code that is more easily understood, and that means it is easier to develop and maintain. 
              This leads to overall cost reduction of the applications that are created. Java code will exist for a long time; long after moving on to different projects. 
              A major goal during development is to make sure that work can be transitioned to another developer, or to another team of developers. 
              This ensures they can continue to maintain and enhance the work without investing an unreasonable effort to understand the code. Difficult to understand code runs the risk of being scrapped and rewritten.

Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.

              JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.

            Let Over Lambda is one of the most hardcore computer programming books out there. Starting with the fundamentals, it
            describes the most advanced features of the most advanced language: Common Lisp. Only the top percentile of programmers
            use lisp and if you can understand this book you are in the top percentile of lisp programmers. If you are looking for a
            dry coding manual that re-hashes common-sense techniques in whatever langue du jour, this book is not for you. This book
            is about pushing the boundaries of what we know about programming. While this book teaches useful skills that can help
            solve your programming problems today and now, it has also been designed to be entertaining and inspiring. If you have
            ever wondered what lisp or even programming itself is really about, this is the book you have been looking for.

              This guide, intended as an explanation of the POSIX standard and as a reference for the POSIX. 1 programming
              library, helps you write more portable programs. Most UNIX systems today are POSIX compliant because the federal
              government requires it for its purchases. Even OSF and UI agree on support for POSIX. Unfortunately, given the
              manufacturer's documentation, it can be difficult to distinguish system-specific features from those features
              defined by POSIX. The POSIX Programmer's Guide is especially helpful if you are writing programs that must run on
              multiple UNIX platforms.
