              Barr Group's Embedded C Coding Standard was developed to minimize bugs in firmware by focusing on practical rules that keep bugs out, while also improving the maintainability and portability of embedded software. The coding standard details a set of guiding principles as well as specific naming conventions and other rules for the use of data types, functions, preprocessor macros, variables and much more. Individual rules that have been demon- strated to reduce or eliminate certain types of bugs are highlighted1

              In this book we will cover some finer points of more advanced programming aspects in the Java language. General programming guidelines and the use of exceptions in Java will be the subjects discussed. 
              Coding standards for Java lead to greater consistency within the code as a whole. Improved consistency produces code that is more easily understood, and that means it is easier to develop and maintain. 
              This leads to overall cost reduction of the applications that are created. Java code will exist for a long time; long after moving on to different projects. 
              A major goal during development is to make sure that work can be transitioned to another developer, or to another team of developers. 
              This ensures they can continue to maintain and enhance the work without investing an unreasonable effort to understand the code. Difficult to understand code runs the risk of being scrapped and rewritten.

Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.
