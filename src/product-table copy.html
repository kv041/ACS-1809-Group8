      This book is about clean codes and how to write them. It is also about bad codes and how to clean them up. The dangers of writing messy code are real. Even if they function well now, sooner or later, several hours will be lost trying to figure them out in the nearest or far future. And thats if you are lucky. Dirty code has been known to ruin the entire project and cause the failure of otherwise great products. This book presents some of the simplest but highly effective tips and tricks that every developer needs to write a clean, smell-free code. It breaks down some of the challenges and hindrances that developers are likely to encounter on the road to writing clean code and offers time-tested strategies for overcoming them. If you are concerned about messy code and how it has been affecting the quality of your work, Clean Code: Best Tips and Tricks in the World of Clean Coding offers a clear road to the light. In this book, you will learn how to recognize bad code, how to write clean code from scratch, as well as the tips and tricks to clean up already dirty code to make it readable and error-free while maintaining functionality.

      Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology, and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories.

      Barr Group's Embedded C Coding Standard was developed to minimize bugs in firmware by focusing on practical rules that keep bugs out, while also improving the maintainability and portability of embedded software. The coding standard details a set of guiding principles as well as specific naming conventions and other rules for the use of data types, functions, preprocessor macros, variables and much more. Individual rules that have been demon- strated to reduce or eliminate certain types of bugs are highlighted1

      In this book we will cover some finer points of more advanced programming aspects in the Java language. General programming guidelines and the use of exceptions in Java will be the subjects discussed. 
      Coding standards for Java lead to greater consistency within the code as a whole. Improved consistency produces code that is more easily understood, and that means it is easier to develop and maintain. 
      This leads to overall cost reduction of the applications that are created. Java code will exist for a long time; long after moving on to different projects. 
      A major goal during development is to make sure that work can be transitioned to another developer, or to another team of developers. 
      This ensures they can continue to maintain and enhance the work without investing an unreasonable effort to understand the code. Difficult to understand code runs the risk of being scrapped and rewritten.

Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.

      JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.

      "Wow. Chapter 5 details every circuit artifact that I have encountered in the past 30 years in a thorough, pragmatic, and straightforward way. My only "twinge" is that it discloses and explains (in glorious graphical detail and with real part numbers) many topics that I thought were my personal trade secrets. I love the plots. I know that it must take an enormous effort to collate all of the device characteristics. It is worth the effort. The way the data is presented allows the reader to get terrific perspective on a lot of landscape in a single view. Nice work.

      This guide, intended as an explanation of the POSIX standard and as a reference for the POSIX. 1 programming library, helps you write more portable programs. Most UNIX systems today are POSIX compliant because the federal government requires it for its purchases. Even OSF and UI agree on support for POSIX. Unfortunately, given the manufacturer's documentation, it can be difficult to distinguish system-specific features from those features defined by POSIX. The POSIX Programmer's Guide is especially helpful if you are writing programs that must run on multiple UNIX platforms.
