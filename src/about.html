        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Our story begins for years ago, when two brothers were driving back home from a large book retailer in
          dissapointment. Henry, a veteran Project Manager in the Winnipeg IT scene, and John, the local UNIX Wizard and
          expert application programmer, yet again failed to find particular texts they were looking for. Leveraging their
          decades of experience in the field, they hunkered down and eventually amassed a massive collection of rare
          tomes, hot titles, and old Classics. Word spread fast of this Cornucopia of IT Knowledge, and the two friendly
          brothers saw an opportunity to share the splendour!</p>
  
        <p>Thus the Shoppe was borne; the J&amp;H Computer Shoppe has been faithfully serving Manitoba's IT community
          since. Our expertise has grown, and now carry a vast array of titles from all sorts of disciplines in IT:
          hardware, software, firmware, project management, and maybe a bit of fun stuff too If that particular text is
          not currently in our supply, don't worry! - we've got <em>connections</em>. We can find it and get it to you,
          one way or another. </p>
        <p>Our contacts within publishers, local and global IT companies, universities, hardware and software vendors, and many others can help you find the information you need. Please feel free to <a class="smallcap" href="contact.html">contact us</a> at any time with any inquiries you might have. Thanks for shopping J&amp;H Computer Booke Shoppe!</p>
